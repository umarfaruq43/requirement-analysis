# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.  

Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a **Booking Management System**. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing **clarity, precision, and structure** in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  

It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, ensuring that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs.  

During this phase, developers and analysts:  
- Communicate with stakeholders to **understand the problem domain**.  
- Translate business needs into **functional and non-functional requirements**.  
- Create documentation, diagrams, and models to provide a **clear blueprint** for development.  

✅ **Key Goal:** To establish a shared understanding between stakeholders and the development team, minimizing risks of miscommunication and ensuring successful project execution.
